                <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl my-2">What is 0xNotes? Never heard of that.</h2>
                <p>0xNotes is an open-source, end-to-end encrypted note-taking app. End-to-end encryption ensures that only you can read your notes, not hackers, not even us. Itâ€™s somewhat similar to Notion (except for the pages), so you can add images, tables, code, to-do list, embed YouTube, and more. 0xNotes is developed by <a href="https://brianthe.dev" className="text-blue-500  text-md hover:text-blue-600">brian-the-dev</a> and <a href="https://thriveshadow.com" className="text-blue-500  text-md hover:text-blue-600">ThriveShadow</a> for a computer science competition.</p>
                <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl my-2">How secure is the encryption?</h2>
                <p>A 256-bit encryption key is derived from your password using PBKDF2 (512-bit, salted, 100,000 iterations). Every note and title is encrypted separately with AES-CTR using that encryption key and a random 8-byte nonce. Unless your password is weak, a hacker would need to try 2^256 combinations. To visualize this, 3b1b has a video about 256-bit security:</p>

                <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl my-2">Is it safe to store my password on 0xNotes?</h2>
                <p>Actually, we don't store your password. As stated above, we use PBKDF2 to generate a 512-bit hash. The first 256-bit is your encryption key, while the last 256-bit is your authentication key. The authentication key is transported and stored securely in our database.</p>
                <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl my-2">Why can't I use my email to register?</h2>
                <p>0xNotes doesn't collect your email address to protect your privacy.</p>
                <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl my-2">Why is it named 0xNotes?</h2>
                <p>For some programming languages, hexadecimal is often prefixed with "0x". Although 0xNotes isn't valid hexadecimal, we think it's a simple and perfect name for our app.</p>
                <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl my-2">Can I contribute?</h2>
                <p>That would be great! Just head over to our <a href="https://github.com/brian-the-dev/0xNotes/" className="text-blue-500  text-md hover:text-blue-600">GitHub page</a>. Make sure to read the guidelines and the code of conduct.</p>
                <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl my-2">Can I change my password?</h2>
                <p>Currently, you can't change your password because the encryption key will change. This means that all of your notes must be downloaded and encrypted with your new password.</p>
                <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl my-2">I found a bug. What should I do?</h2>
                <p>Please check if the bug is already reported. If not, you may create an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/brian-the-dev/0xNotes/issues" className="text-blue-500  text-md hover:text-blue-600">GitHub page</a>.</p>
